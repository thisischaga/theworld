    The attack surface is expanding with widespread IoT adoption, complex software supply chains and AI integration in critical systems. In 2026, organizations and governments need to anticipate more sophisticated, orchestrated and automated threats.
    </p>

    <h2>Ransomware and evolved extortion</h2>
    <p>
    Ransomware continues to evolve: double extortion, public data leaks and pressure on partner chains. Prevention includes network segmentation, immutable backups and regular incident simulations.
    </p>

    <h2>Supply-chain and targeted attacks</h2>
    <p>
    Compromising libraries or CI/CD pipelines enables attackers to infect clients at scale. Audits, signature verification and reducing non-essential dependencies are key measures to lower this risk.
    </p>

    <h2>AI exploitation</h2>
    <p>
    The same models that help defense are used by attackers to automate reconnaissance, generate targeted emails and bypass filters. Detecting anomalous behavior and limiting model usage rights are important strategies.
    </p>

    <h2>IoT and OT: converging risks</h2>
    <p>
    Integrating industrial systems and IoT increases attack criticality. Visibility, robust access controls and IT/OT segmentation are crucial to reduce operational impact.
    </p>

    <h2>Modern defensive approach</h2>
    <p>
    For 2026, effective defense combines identity management, zero trust, behavioral detection and automated response. Training teams and users remains an often overlooked but essential pillar.
    </p>

    <p>
    Facing these threats, resilience becomes the primary goal: reduce the attack surface, prepare rapid responses and implement continuity mechanisms. Cross-sector cooperation, information sharing and appropriate regulation will strengthen collective security.
